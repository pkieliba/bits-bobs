tidbits
============

This repository contains a set of small programming challanges/exercises, written in Python 3. The challanges gathered here were found in **coding interviews** and are focused on **algorithms** and **data structures**.

Challanges are grouped based on the topic and embedded in a separate jupyter notebook. Unit tests for each challange are provided in *testBit.py*.
